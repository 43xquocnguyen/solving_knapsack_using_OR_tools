# Solving the Knapsack Problems Using Google OR Tools
Solving the Knapsack Problems using Google OR Tools

I have implemented for solving Knapsack Problem - Assignment 2 / UIT.CS106

For all of the instances of test cases I got from: https://github.com/likr/kplib

- For each group of test cases, I just select randomly 8 instances of test cases for experimental running test
- The result for the first running that I ran is stored as Dataset in 'result/running_results.csv'
