Solving the Knapsack Problems using Google OR Tools

I have implemented for solving Knapsack Problem - Assignment 2 / UIT.CS106

For all of the instances of test cases I got from: https://github.com/likr/kplib

- For each group of test cases, I just select randomly 8 instances of test cases for experimental running test
